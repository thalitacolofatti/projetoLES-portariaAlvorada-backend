# projetoLES-portariaAlvorada-backend
This is a NodeJs project for the Software Engineering Lab class of Fatec SP.
The project consists of a consultation and registration system for those responsible for students who can take them of school. After registering the person responsible, it is possible to link them to one or more students. This link can also be deleted if necessary. It still needs adjustments to be complete.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm start
```
